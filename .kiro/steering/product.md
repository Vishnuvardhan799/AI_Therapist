AI Therapist - Virtual Therapeutic Assistant

A real-time voice-based AI therapist application that provides emotional support and mental health guidance through an interactive avatar interface. Built on LiveKit's real-time communication platform with OpenAI's Realtime API for natural conversational experiences.

The assistant offers:

- Compassionate, judgment-free emotional support
- Active listening and empathetic responses
- Coping strategies and mindfulness techniques
- Crisis resource guidance when appropriate
- Real-time voice interaction with visual avatar

This is a support tool, not a replacement for professional mental health care.
